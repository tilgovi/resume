Employment History
------------------

**The New York Times** (Jan. 2020 — Present)

Working across boundaries between product engineering, information security, and
corporate infrastructure, I accelerated strategic phase transitions to adopt new
platforms, sunset legacy systems, and unlock collaborations across product teams
responsibile for business-critical news publishing systems.

* Developed a roadmap to replace on-premise network appliances with cloud-native
  application gateways and establish a foothold for application teams within the
  publishing group to migrate workloads to the company's new cloud platform

  * Deployed an internal Istio gateway within new company Kubernetes clusters in
    AWS to centralize responsibility for traffic ingress within company platform
    teams and decentralize routing responsibility to publishing product teams

  * Unified authentication, session management, and authorization enforcement in
    publishing applications, using Open Policy Agent, Ory Hydra, and NextAuth.js
    to enhance the shared gateway with identity-aware proxy features

  * Managed team and service dependencies to ensure that transitions to the new
    cloud platform, gateway proxy, and authentication systems were made without
    downtime

* Integrated identity systems to facilitate safer sharing of infrastructure and
  publishing content across platforms and workloads

  * Aligned identity references across publishing applications and shared Vault
    clusters to allow workloads across heterogenous deployment platforms to act
    as service accounts within publishing applications

  * Configured identity integrations across cloud providers to ease incremental
    workload migrations

* Provided critical feedback and partnership to the platform engineering teams
  regarding developer experience and platform features

* Championed monorepo adoption to improve collaboration across teams within the
  publishing engineering group

**Remix** (Apr. 2017 — Dec. 2019)

As an individual contributor and as a founding member of an organization-wide
front-end engineering working group, I accelerated development and deployment of
web-based geospatial applications for city transportation planners.

JavaScript + React + Redux, Python, Ruby + Rails, Terraform, Webpack

* Developed abstractions to enable rapid migration of an application from
  Leaflet to Mapbox GL

* Developed organizational capacity to begin continuous deployment of microservices

* Transitioned a major project out of active development and prepared it for
  long term maintenance

**Medal** (Jan. 2016 — Dec. 2016)

As the first full-time engineering hire, I recruited a team of engineers to
develop solutions for medical records management in clinical and research
settings.

Python (Django), C#, Amazon Web Services, Docker, Terraform

* Developed infrastructure-as-code supporting deployment under strict compliance
  requirements

* Established interviewing and onboarding processes for new engineers

**Hypothes.is** (Dec. 2011 — Sep. 2015)

I worked as technical lead of a not-for-profit initiative to develop open source
annotation services supporting digital research, publishing and pedagogy.

Python (Pyramid), JavaScript (AngularJS), Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, Amazon Web
Services, Ansible, Docker

* Contributed to standards for digital annotation as a member of the World Wide
  Web Consortium (W3C) Web Annotations Working Group

* Developed modern, open-source JavaScript applications, libraries and browser
  extensions

**Meebo** (Sep. 2009 — Dec. 2011)

Python (Gevent, Twisted), C, Erlang, CouchDB, Cassandra, Redis, Graphite, Nginx,
Puppet

* Introduced co-routine techniques for reducing memory use and time-to-ship for
  microservices

* Contributed to Apache CouchDB, becoming an active project maintainer
